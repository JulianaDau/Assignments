#Example 1

#Find:\s{2,}
#Replace:,
#Reason: to find consecutive single spaces that are 2 or more characters and 
replace with , to match the .csv file. Needed this way so the single space
between "First string is not detected

```
```
#Example 2
#Find: (\w*),\s(\w*),\s(.*)
#Replace:\2 \1 \(\3\)
#Reason: (\w*) capture the first word, and followed by \s(\w*) finds the 
first word comma and second word. \s(.*) will indicate all the rest 
(university name). On replace the order matches the desired organization 
bringing the second capture to be first and the first capture to second 
position while the third is added parentheses.

```
```
#Example 3
#Find:.mp3\s
#Replace:.mp3\n
#Reason:Indicated to find mp3 and space (.mp3\s) since that is the end of 
each line. In turn indicated to the place a line break at this point so each 
new line start after .mp3

```
```
#Example 4
#Find:
#Replace:
#Reason:
