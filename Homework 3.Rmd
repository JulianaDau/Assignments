#Example 1
#Input:
First String    Second      1.22      3.4
Second          More Text   1.555555  2.2220
Third           x           3         124
#Find:\s{2,}
#Replace:,
#Reason: to find consecutive single spaces that are 2 or more characters and 
replace with , to match the .csv file. Needed this way so the single space
between "First string is not detected
#Result:
First String,Second,1.22,3.4
Second,More Text,1.555555,2.2220
Third,x,3,124
```
```
#Example 2
#Input:
Ballif, Bryan, University of Vermont
Ellison, Aaron, Harvard Forest
Record, Sydne, Bryn Mawr
#Find: (\w*),\s(\w*),\s(.*)
#Replace:\2 \1 \(\3\)
#Reason: (\w*) capture the first word, and followed by \s(\w*) finds the 
first word comma and second word. \s(.*) will indicate all the rest 
(university name). On replace the order matches the desired organization 
bringing the second capture to be first and the first capture to second 
position while the third is added parentheses.
#Result:
Bryan Ballif (University of Vermont)
Aaron Ellison (Harvard Forest)
Sydne Record (Bryn Mawr)

#Find:.mp3\s
#Replace:.mp3\n
#Reason:Indicated to find mp3 and space (.mp3\s) since that is the end of 
each line. In turn indicated to the place a line break at this point so each 
new line start after .mp3
#Result:
0001 Georgia Horseshoe.mp3
0002 Billy In The Lowground.mp3
0003 Winder Slide.mp3
0004 Walking Cane.mp3

#Find:(\d{4}) (\w*) (\w+)
#Replace: (\2) (\3) (_\1)(\4)
#Reason: with (\d{4}) I`m marking the 4 digit sequence as the first item of capture. Followed byt the first word (\w*) and following characters. Changed the order and added _. 
#Result: 
Georgia Horseshoe _0001.mp3
Billy In _The Lowground _0002.mp3
